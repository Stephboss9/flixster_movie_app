## Introduction:
Flixster is a web application that shows the latest and trending movies all on a beautiful and appealing user interface using The Movie Database API.
I first created this application during my participation in the Summer Interhnsip For Tech Excellence program at CodePath. I've gone ahead and redid the project
in React + TypeScript + Styled Components for styling. I am very proud of this project. I spent lots of time to make it look nice and work smoothly. 

The API I used to fetch movie information is located here: https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs.

## Reflection:
Despite being a simple project I learned a lot about React,  CSS, and TypeScript. Initially, my goal in redoing the project was to dip my hands back into React and TypeScript and make it look a little more professional. I thought it was gonna be all easy till I started implementing things like Infinite Scroll where I learned how to use the useRef hook, refs, and the intersection observer API to accomplish this. While implementing the modal feature I ended up having to understand the position properties including static, absolute, sticky, and relative on a deeper level. It felt really good that I knew how to implement the modal and how to use the relevant CSS properties. I also learned how to use CSS animations to animate things like the back-to-top button. I also dove a little into testing and gained some familiarity using the React-Testing-Library and Vitest together to create some tests for things like checking if the components were rendering and checking the existence of certain elements. This project wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, I faced many challenges. An example was figuring out how to structure my code and making design decisions. I kept going back and forth between ideas. To help me with this I prioritized scalability and clean code.
