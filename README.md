## Introduction:
Flixster is a web application that shows the latest and trending movies all on a beautiful and appealing user interface using The Movie Database API.
I created this application during my participation in the Summer Interhnsip For Tech Excellence program at CodePath. I am very proud of this project.
I spent lots of time to make it look nice and work smoothly. Give it a try!

The API I used to fetch movie information is located here: https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs.
